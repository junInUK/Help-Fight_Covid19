# Help-Fight_Covid19
This is a project to let people help each other and fight to COVID-19

Background Information:

As the COVID-19 has seriously damaged human’s lives and the economy. Lots of families are losing their lovers, lots of isolating people need help but lots of key workers feel tired when they fight with the virus for long hours. To reduce the burden of our key workers, lots of volunteers stand out and say they can help. But how to organize them and match the volunteers and the person who needs help effectively and easily? Here we can build an app to do this job. 

Requirement:

Step 1: Goal (milestone) Finish single-user version.

The app should allow CRUD users/ volunteers.
The app should allow CRUD jobs. 

Users should have some attributes like id, name, age, address, postcode, phone number, whether living alone and whether a volunteer. 

Jobs should have some attributes like id, user id, job description and status like: no one response, someone undertaking the job and job done! 


Step 2: Goal (milestone) Finish multi-user version.

The app should allow multi-user/ more users to use the app at the same time. (performance requirement?)

As a normal user, the app should allow 


Register their information.
Update their information.
Check their information. 

As a normal user, the app should allow

Post a job( requirement).
Update their jobs ( if no one undertakes the job)
Check their jobs
Delete their jobs( if no one undertakes the job and the job didn’t finish) 

As a volunteer, the app should allow

Check jobs based on some conditions ( like the jobs close to me within xx miles or based on the priority).
Undertake the job if the volunteer thinks they can help. 
Update the job status to “job has done”.
